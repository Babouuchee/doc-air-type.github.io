        <p>The Air-Type is a game project made by 4 students at Epitech Technology Bordeaux in France.</p>

            <p>R-Type is a horizontally scrolling shooter arcade video game developped and released by Irem in 1987 and the first game in the R-Type series.</p>
            <p>The player controls a star ship, the R-9 "Arrowhead", in its efforts to destroy the Bydo, a powerful alien race bent on wiping out all of mankind.</p>
            <p>R-Type was commercially successful and celebrated by critics for its graphics and addictive gameplay, but was criticized for its difficulty. It is commonly cited as one of the best shoot'em up video games, and one of the greatest video games of all time.</p>
